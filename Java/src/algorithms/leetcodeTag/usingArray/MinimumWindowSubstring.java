/**
 * Given a string S and a string MeiTuan2, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in
 * MeiTuan2 in complexity O(n).
 *
 * For example,
 * S = "ADOBECODEBANC"
 * MeiTuan2 = "ABC"
 * Minimum window is "BANC".
 *
 * Note:
 * If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in MeiTuan2, return the empty string "".
 * If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum
 * window in S.
