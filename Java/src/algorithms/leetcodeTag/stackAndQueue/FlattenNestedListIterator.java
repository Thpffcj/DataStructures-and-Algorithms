/**
 * Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.
 * Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]],
 * By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next
 * should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Given the list [1,[4,[6]]],
 * By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next
 * should be: [1,4,6].
